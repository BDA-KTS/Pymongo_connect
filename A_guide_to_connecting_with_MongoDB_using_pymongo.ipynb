    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL database management system designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. \n",
    "It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with structured and unstructured data. \n",
    "MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which allows for the storage of complex data structures and nested arrays,\n",
    "providing more flexibility than traditional relational databases. It supports features such as indexing, replication, sharding,\n",
    "and aggregation, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems.\n",
    "PyMongo is the official Python client library for MongoDB. It allows Python developers to interact with MongoDB databases using a\n",
    "simple and intuitive API. With PyMongo, you can perform various operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting\n",
    "documents in MongoDB collections directly from your Python code. It provides a flexible and powerful way to work with MongoDB \n",
    "databases, making it a popular choice for Python developers working with MongoDB. In this tutorial we will connect to an already \n",
    "existing MongoDB collection with the PyMongo library and generate some statistics out of the data"

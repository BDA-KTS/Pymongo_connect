# A Guide to Using MongoDB With Python Using PyMongo

This tutorial is deigned for users who want to connect to a MongoDb collection using the Pymongo library and generate statistics out of the data present in the collection. It assumes a basic knowledge of Python and MongoDB. By the end of this tutorial, an user will be able to connect to a MongoDB collection hosted on a server and display some statistics about the data.

MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL database management system designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with structured and unstructured data. MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which allows for the storage of complex data structures and nested arrays, providing more flexibility than traditional relational databases. It supports features such as indexing, replication, sharding, and aggregation, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems. PyMongo is the official Python client library for MongoDB. It allows Python developers to interact with MongoDB databases using a simple and intuitive API. With PyMongo, you can perform various operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting documents in MongoDB collections directly from your Python code. It provides a flexible and powerful way to work with MongoDB databases, making it a popular choice for Python developers working with MongoDB. In this tutorial we will connect to an already existing MongoDB collection with the PyMongo library and generate some statistics out of the data

## Learning Objectives

- Install the pymongo Library
- Explore the library to connect to a MongoDB collection
- Generate some statistics out of the data
- Obtain a data dump

## Target Audience

This tutorial is meant for users who wants to use PyMongo library to connect to a MongoDB collection. This tutorial aims to put all related information at one place.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of python (https://www.python.org/)
- Basic knowledge of MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Already stored data in MongoDB collection

## Difficulty Level
Easy

## Duration
2 hours

## Social Science Use Case
John is a researcher who wants to generate some statistics for a huge data that is collected and stored in MongoDB collection. For connecting and exploring the huge dataset, he uses the pymongo library to generate details about the collection like size of the collection, number of records, number of documents and generates a dump out of the collection. He can then re use this method for any other data collected and stored in MongoDB to generate statistics out of the data.
